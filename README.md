# Light Phone Contact Extraction

If you have a light phone 2 and also can't figure out how to export your contacts, you can use this!

Run the script with python 3 after installing selenium (and the google chromedriver). Input your email, password, and device you'd like to scrape. Let it sit for a few minutes (the light phone website is quite slow) and have your contacts nicely formatted.

I got the chromedriver (on MacOS) through `brew install chromedriver`, and selenium through `pip install selenium`.
If you have trouble using this, please shoot me an email!
